# 📘 Math Question Classification using Classical Machine Learning

This project builds a **classical machine learning pipeline** to classify high school mathematics questions into subtopics such as **Algebra, Geometry, Number Theory, Precalculus**, etc.

Each question is stored as an **individual JSON file**, and the dataset is already split into **training** and **testing** sets, organized in **class-wise folders**.

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify math questions into their respective subtopics
- Use **classical ML techniques** (no deep learning for classification)
- Maintain interpretability and simplicity
- Ensure no data leakage by using pre-split train/test data
